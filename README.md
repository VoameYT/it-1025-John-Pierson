 // shark project This program is about sammy being awesome, John Pierson being the best programmer , and the shark swimming. The actual purpose of this program was to help learn functions/ classes/ and objects.


// sql project. This first sql project was to learn about sorting data in your database. This specific one is sorting products by price in descending order 

// Sqp products 25. For this one I had to sort the colums to only show name, unit, and price > 25. This one was hard and confusing and I had a bad time trying to figure it out as there is no page on w3 showing this that I could find.
